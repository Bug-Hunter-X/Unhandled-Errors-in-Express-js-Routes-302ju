# Unhandled Errors in Express.js Routes

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling in routes.  The `bug.js` file shows an example where potential errors (like a user not being found or database issues) are not properly handled, leading to application crashes or unexpected responses.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling, ensuring graceful degradation and informative error messages to the client.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies (assuming you have Node.js and npm installed).
3. Run `node bug.js`. 
4. Make requests to `/users/:id` with invalid IDs or try to access it when a database issue might occur. Observe the server's response and behavior.
5. Repeat the same steps after replacing the file with `bugSolution.js` to see the difference in error handling.

## Learning Points

- Always handle potential errors in asynchronous operations (like database queries).
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for 'Not Found', 500 for 'Internal Server Error').
- Provide informative error messages to the client without exposing sensitive details.
